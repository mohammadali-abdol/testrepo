<h1 align="center"><font size="5">Classification with Python</font></h1>

In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

Let's first load required libraries:
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

"""### About dataset

This dataset is about past loans. The **Loan_train.csv** data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

| Field          | Description                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loan_status    | Whether a loan is paid off on in collection                                           |
| Principal      | Basic principal loan amount at the                                                    |
| Terms          | Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule |
| Effective_date | When the loan got originated and took effects                                         |
| Due_date       | Since it’s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date                |
| Age            | Age of applicant                                                                      |
| Education      | Education of applicant                                                                |
| Gender         | The gender of applicant                                                               |

*   Logistic Regression

*   You can go above and change the pre-processing, feature selection, feature-extraction, and so on, to make a better model.
